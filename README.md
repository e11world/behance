## Embeddable Appreciate Button for Behance

![Cover image - Behance button](http://i.imgur.com/CsYQ6G7.png)

Behance doesn't have an embeddable "like" button, unlike Facebook or Twitter. So, I made one.

Try appreciating this project from the demo page [here](http://whoeverest.github.com/behance/behance-button-demo.html).

It's a hackish proof-of-concept more then anything, so feel free to try it out, but don't expect it to work forever; eventually Behance will fix the thing that makes the button work.

You can find the jQuery plugin [here](https://github.com/whoeverest/behance/blob/gh-pages/behance-button-jquery-plugin.js).
